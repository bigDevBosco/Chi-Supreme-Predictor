Basic Idea is predicting football/soccer matches.


This predictions will be calculated based on defined logics and basics maths.


The data to be used will be Average Goals Scored, Average Goal Conceded and team's current form with predefined out the box logic.

## Prediction Results


The prediction Results will correct Score and 1X2 Predictions. 


The correct Score will be the initial project.


## Issues
Initially the data will be loaded manual


but to be automated later in the project. 

that is where API will come in.
